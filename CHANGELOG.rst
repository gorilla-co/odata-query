Unreleased
^^^^^^^^^^

* Sqlalchemy: support for queries with multiple entities


[0.6.0] - 2022-06-03
--------------------

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Django; Rework Django query transformer to use Django query nodes more.
  With the release of Django 4, we can now use ``Lookup``, ``Function``, and other
  Django query nodes in queries directly instead of relying on the keyworded
  syntax. For older Django versions, we can still transform those nodes to the
  keyworded syntax.
* Deps; Upgraded Sphinx and the ReadTheDocs theme.


Fixed
^^^^^

* Django; Support comparisons of boolean funcs to booleans
  (e.g. ``contains(a, 'b') eq true``)

--------------------

Added
^^^^^

* Added ``NodeTransformers``\ , which are like ``NodeVisitors`` but replace visited
  nodes with the returned value.
* Initial API documentation.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The AstTo{ORMQuery} visitors for SQLAlchemy and Django now have the same
  interface.
* AstToDjangoQVisitor now builds subqueries for ``any()/all()`` itself, instead
  of relying on ``SubQueryToken``\ s and a seperate visitor.
* Made all AST Nodes ``frozen`` (read-only), so they can be hashed.
* Replaced ``field_mapping`` on the ORM visitors with a more general
  ``AliasRewriter`` based on the new ``NodeTransformers``.
